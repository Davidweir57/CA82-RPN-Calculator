# Template repo for CA282 RPN calculator.

## Prerequisites

This is an npm project.  It depends upon a number of npm modules.

To install the necessary npm modules, use:

    $ npm install

To build the static/index.html file, use:

  - either
    $ make -C static build

  - or:
    $ cd static && make build

If you do not have asciidoc, then read the comment in static/Makefile.

Asciidoc, node and npm are available:

  - in the default CI image on GitLab,
  - in the TermCast/docker environment, and
  - on the student SSH server (available as regular TermCast).

The advantage of working on the TermCast docker environment is that you won't be
competing with your classmates for ports.  You can't all run your server on the
default port at the same time.

## What's here?

- `index.js` -- This is the node/Javascript server implementation.  You will have to extend this.
- `Makefile` -- This contains some phony build and test targets.
- `node_modules` -- This is generated by "npm install".
- `package.json` -- npm package files which you can ignore.
- `package-lock.json` -- npm package files which you can ignore.
- `README.md` -- This file.
- `static` -- Static content.  The file index.(ascii|html) contains your instructions for implementing an RPN
  calculator.
- `test-random.sh` -- Shell script for testing the "random" API.
- `test-rpn.sh` -- Shell script for testing the "rpn" API.
- `test-rpn` -- Implementation files for testing the "rpn" API (you shouldn't need too much in here).

## Task

Your task is as follows:

1. Extend the implementation in `index.js` such that it implements the RPN-calculator API described in
   static/index.(ascii|html).
2. Ensure `make run-test-rpn` succeeds.
3. Complete the `.gitlab-ci.yml` CI config files such that the tests are run (and pass!) when you push
   your work to GitLab.
